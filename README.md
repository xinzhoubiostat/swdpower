# SWD Power
Power calculation for SWDs with binary outcomes

Compile the program using the makefile

The program is invoked by 

SWD input_filename output_filename
  
The input file is a text file containing the values of input parameters. I include a sample input file (in.txt) for illustration.
The output file returns the power calculated for the scenario described in the input file.
